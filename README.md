# 🤖 Machine Learning Practice (Colab)

This repository contains my **Machine Learning practice notebooks** created while learning and experimenting with various ML concepts using **Google Colab**.  
Each module focuses on a specific stage of the ML workflow — from Python basics to data preprocessing and model preparation.
