## 📘 Completed Module: `01_Basics/`
I’ve completed the **Basics folder**, building a strong foundation in Python and essential data-handling libraries.

### 🔹 Topics Practiced:
- Python fundamentals (data types, loops, conditionals, functions)  
- Data structures (lists, tuples, sets, dictionaries)  
- File handling and exception management  
- NumPy for numerical computing  
- Pandas for data manipulation and cleaning  
- Data visualization using Matplotlib & Seaborn  
- Mini end-to-end exercises combining all topics  

### 🧠 Key Skills Gained:
- Confident in writing clean and modular Python code  
- Able to handle, analyze, and visualize data effectively  
- Comfortable using libraries essential for machine learning workflows
