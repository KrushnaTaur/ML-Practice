### 🔹 03_Exploratory_Data_Analysis (EDA)/
Explored and visualized datasets to extract data-driven insights.

**Notebooks:**
1. `01_Univariate_Analysis.ipynb` – Explore single-variable patterns using histograms, boxplots, countplots.  
2. `02_Bivariate_Multivariate_Analysis.ipynb` – Study relationships between variables with scatterplots, pairplots, and barplots.  
3. `03_Correlation_and_Heatmaps.ipynb` – Compute correlations and visualize them using heatmaps to detect multicollinearity.  
4. `04_Distribution_and_Outlier_Visualization.ipynb` – Analyze distributions and detect outliers using IQR and Z-score.  
5. `05_EDA_Report_Preparation.ipynb` – Generate structured EDA reports using `ydata_profiling` and `sweetviz`.
